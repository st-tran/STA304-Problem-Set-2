## STA304 Problem Set 2

## Getting Started
This report relies on data that needs to be obtained from the [Chass Data Centre](http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/myaccess.html) first:
1) Open the [linked page](http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/myaccess.html)
2) Click `SDA @ Chass` on the sidebar
3) Sign in with UofT credentials & continue in English
4) Find `General social surveys (GSS)` and go to it
5) Download the data for 2017 as `Customized Subset`, using the following options:
    - CSV File
    - Select all variables
    - Data definitions for `STATA`
6) Once the data and labels are downloaded, save them to the project directory.
7) Change the filename(s) in `gss_cleaning.R` to reflect your dataset and run the script.
8) A new dataset, `gss.csv`, will be created and that can be used to reproduce our report.
